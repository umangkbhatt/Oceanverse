#Understand how to use a if conditional in python. Ask the user to enter a number and check if the number is even or odd (1 point).

# Take the number from User
number = float(input("Please enter anumber: "))

# This 'if' condition checks if number is even. 
if number%2==0:
    print("Number is even")

# This 'if' condition checks if number is odd. 
if number%2!=0:
    print("Number is old")
